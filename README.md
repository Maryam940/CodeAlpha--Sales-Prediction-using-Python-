ðŸ“Š Sales Prediction using Machine Learning
ðŸ”¹ Project Overview

This project predicts future sales based on advertising spend across different channels (TV, Radio, Newspaper, and optionally Target Segment/Platform). The aim is to help businesses make data-driven marketing decisions by analyzing how changes in advertising investments impact sales outcomes.

The project follows a step-by-step workflow:

Data Preparation â€“ Cleaning, transformation, and feature selection.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) â€“ Understanding relationships between ad spend and sales.

Model Training â€“ Regression (Linear Regression, Random Forest) to forecast sales.

Evaluation â€“ Comparing models using RMSE & RÂ² scores.

Insights â€“ Analyzing advertising impact and ROI through feature importance & sensitivity analysis.

Interactive Gradio App â€“ Simple web interface to test different advertising scenarios.

ðŸ”¹ Features

Predict sales based on TV, Radio, Newspaper spends.

Support for categorical features (Target Segment, Platform) if available.

Compare Linear Regression vs. Random Forest performance.

Visualizations:
